# Visualizing Health Data
Alec Graham, Aung K. Soe, and Jerri Ye

Many data visualization tools exist to show costs of healthcare across regions in the United States. The goals of each tool are similar, to compare the costs and highlight areas where the cost of care is higher than the national average for the same types of diagnosis types and procedures. In this visualization tool, the focus would also be on cost but the goals would be to highlight areas in the United States where the cost of care exceeds the national average, to find outliers in the cost of care against more densely populated high-cost of living metropolitan areas. Researchers need a tool that can tell them where the cost of care is unreasonably high against the cost of living for specific disease types. In this tool, we take data from 2009 and compile all the beneficiary claims data and map these out in a county based heat map.
